      \item {{ \textbf{Investigating Instances of Gun Violence using Pointer Networks:} Proposed a novel model that employs Attention Mechanism in Sequence-to-Sequence learning and Pointer Neural Nets to extract the attributes of gun violence events from news reports.}}
      \item {{ \textbf{Quantifying Semantic Similarity:} Designed and implemented a sequence-to-sequence model ( Long Short-Term Memory Network) for classifying semantically similar and dissimilar questions from Quora, carrying an accuracy of 83\% on validation after tuning.}}
      \item { \textbf{The Fake News Stance Classification:} Achieved an accuracy of 88\% on classifying fake news from the genuine ones to four discrete levels - agree, discuss, disagree, and unrelated using handcrafted linguistic features along with distance features from vectorized fields(Word2Vec). Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and XGBoost algorithms were used for \\ performance comparison.}
      \item { \textbf{Home Value Prediction:} Modeled Zillow's house rent prediction problem using Microsoft's LightGBM algorithm with a mean absolute error of 0.064.}
