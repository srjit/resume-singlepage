      \item {{ \textbf{Quantifying Semantic Similarity of Sentences using Long Short-Term Memory Neural Nets:} Designed and implemented a sequence-to-sequence model (LSTM network) for classifying semantically similar questions in Quora from non-similar ones. After tuning, the network was able to obtain an accuracy of 83\% on validation.}}
      \item {{\textbf{Finetuning AlexNet for Custom Classification : } Tuned the layers of pre-trained alexnet model for custom binary image \\ classification, obtaining an accuracy ~94\% for the new task.}}
      \item { \textbf{The Fake News Stance Classification:} Achieved an accuracy of ~88\% on the task of classifying fake news from the genuine ones to four discrete levels - agree, discuss, disagree, unrelated using handcrafted linguistic features along with distance features from vectorized fields(Word2Vec). Random Forests, Support Vector Machines and XGBoost algorithms were used for performance comparison.}
      \item { \textbf{Home Value Prediction:} Modeled Zillow's house rent prediction problem using Microsoft's LightGBM and obtained a mean absolute error of 0.064}
